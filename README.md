# sql_data_warehouse_project

Welcome to my first build of a data warehouse with SQL server, including ETL processes, analytics and data modelling

---- Process and journey to be updated as I progress

Personal goals for the project:
Utilise standardized naming conventions for ease of reading and writing as well as experience for future team projects
Further elevate analysis by taking clean business ready data into PowerBi and utilise data visualation to to simplify complex data into easily understood actionable data


-- Specifications:
* Data Sources: import data from 2 sources (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* Data Quality: cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis
* Integration: combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model design for analytical querying
* Scope: focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is nnot required
* Documentation: provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics usage
